Local Search Algorithms

Given N-Queen Problem for N = {10, 50 100, ...}

Simulated Annealing: Improved for large states, further improvements with Numpy are possible
(Metaheuristic: Only row or column(maybe changed easily) conflicts are avoided)

Genetic Algorithm: Works really fast with excellent results for large board size(Ä°pynb file, has been written with Jupyter)
(Metaheuristic: Row and column conflicts are avoided)
