Given N-Queen Problem for N = {10, 50 100, ...}
Hill Climbing
First Choice Hill Climbing
Simulated Annealing

Python built-in dictionaries i.e Hash Tables and built-in Lists i.e 
Arrays/Vectors were used as data structures for the given problem for 
easier access and storage. 

Please mind that algorithms may be used with different heuristics for 
better results, though given heuristics also minimize the cost optimally 
in given large pool of finite states. 

Update: Simulate Annealing
